# Rename-Media-Files
This simple script will rename the files in a directory with a show's name, season #, and episode # (e.g., One Piece S01E01).

## Usage
```sh
./rename_media_files.sh <name_to_precede> <season_number> <directory_path>
```
NOTE: The files in the directory must already be ordered before running this script. Also, the directory must contain only the media files you are trying to rename.
